# MolSys-AI: from tools to intelligence

- Intelligent agents require coherent, well-defined tools
- MolSys-AI emerges naturally from a unified ecosystem
- Current state: documentation-aware chatbot
- Under the hood: LLaMA 3 (8B) + RAG + light fine-tuning
- Near-term direction: CLI and agent-based interaction

“We did not start from AI; AI becomes possible because the tools are coherent.”
Frases que funcionan muy bien aquí:
“MolSys-AI is constrained by design.”
“This is assistance, not automation of science.”
