# MolSysViewer: visualization as part of the workflow

- Visualization is not a final step, but an integral part of the workflow
- Fully controlled from Python and Jupyter notebooks
- Designed for reproducibility rather than manual interaction
- Built on top of MolSysMT molecular systems

Strong idea: Exploration can be interactive; science remains reproducible.
“Visualization should follow the same rules as the rest of the workflow.”
