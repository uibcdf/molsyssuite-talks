# Beyond the core: ecosystem expansion

- TopoMT: molecular cavities and topography analysis
- ElastNetMT: elastic network models and mechanical descriptors
- PharmacophoreMT: pharmacophore extraction and representation
- BiFreeMT: biologically motivated free-energy–related workflows
- All modules share a common semantic and architectural foundation

“These tools are different in scope, but identical in philosophy.”
