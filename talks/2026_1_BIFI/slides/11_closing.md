# Status, direction, and invitation

- MolSysSuite is under active development
- MolSysMT and MolSysViewer are already mature and usable
- The ecosystem is intentionally scoped and evolving
- We are looking for early adopters and beta testers
- Feedback will help shape the near-term direction

“This is not a finished product, but it is a solid foundation we want to share,
test, and shape together.”

“So if there is one thing to take away from this talk,
it’s not a feature or a command — it’s the idea of building tools
that remain coherent as they grow.”
