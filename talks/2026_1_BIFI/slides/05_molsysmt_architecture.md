# MolSysMT architecture

- Multiple molecular system representations and incompatible APIs
- A consensus molecular system model with explicit hierarchical structure
- A unified API for selection, conversion, and system modification
- Coherent molecular workflows independent of data origin or destination

“Once you have this core, the workflow finally becomes coherent.”
