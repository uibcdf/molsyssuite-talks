# Slide 10 — Ecosystem expansion (speaker notes, draft)

Purpose of this slide:
- Reframe MolSysSuite as a coherent ecosystem, not a collection of tools
- Show that growth is organized around a shared semantic core
- Emphasize extensibility without promising features or roadmaps
- Normalize MolSys-AI as a first-class layer within the ecosystem

Core idea:
- MolSysSuite grows by adding layers and tools around a shared MolSys core
- The ecosystem is structured, not fragmented
- Expansion is possible without breaking coherence

Conceptual structure of the slide:
- Central semantic core (MolSys)
- First orbit: fundamental layers of interaction
- Second orbit: specialized and extensible toolkits
- Open-ended outer layer indicating future growth

Reading the diagram (how to guide the audience):
- The center represents MolSys, the shared semantic core
- Everything in the ecosystem operates on this same core
- Distance from the center reflects specialization, not importance

MolSys (shared semantic core):
- Single, explicit definition of a molecular system
- Common language across all tools
- What guarantees coherence as the ecosystem grows

First orbit — foundational layers:
- MolSysMT: manipulation and analysis of molecular systems
- MolSysViewer: structured, reproducible visualization
- MolSys-AI: assistance for structured molecular workflows
- These layers define how scientists interact with MolSys

Important emphasis on MolSys-AI:
- MolSys-AI is not above the ecosystem
- It is one of the fundamental ways of interacting with MolSys
- Intelligence is integrated, not supervisory

Second orbit — specialized toolkits:
- Examples such as TopoMT, PharmacophoreMT, ElastNetMT, BiFreeMT
- These tools address specific scientific questions
- They build on the same MolSys core but are not required by everyone

Open-ended expansion:
- The presence of “...” is intentional
- It indicates that the ecosystem is designed to grow
- New tools can be added without changing the core or breaking workflows

Important emphasis:
- This is not a roadmap
- No tool is mandatory
- The value is in the shared structure, not in the number of components

What NOT to do on this slide:
- Do not explain each toolkit in detail
- Do not discuss future features or timelines
- Do not compare tools against external alternatives
- Do not frame expansion as accumulation

Things NOT to explain:
- Internal dependencies between toolkits
- Implementation or packaging details
- Governance or contribution models (unless asked)

Transition to closing slide:
- Emphasize that MolSysSuite is about a way of organizing molecular work
- Prepare the audience for a conceptual closing and invitation

Timing:
- ~1.5–2 minutes

## Speech (draft)

- “This slide steps back and shows the bigger picture.”

Up to now, we have talked about individual layers:
how molecular systems are defined, visualized, engineered, and assisted.

“This diagram shows how they fit together.”

Guide through the center:

“At the center is MolSys.”
“This is the shared semantic core that everything builds on.”

Explain the first orbit:

“The first orbit contains the foundational layers.”
“MolSysMT for manipulation and analysis.”
“MolSysViewer for visualization.”
“And MolSys-AI for assistance.”

Normalize AI:

“MolSys-AI is not above the system.”
“It is simply another way of interacting with MolSys.”

Explain the second orbit:

“The outer orbit contains specialized toolkits.”
“These address specific questions: topology, pharmacophores, elasticity, and so on.”

Explain the ellipsis:

“The ellipsis is intentional.”
“It means the ecosystem is open.”
“New tools can be added without changing the core.”

Key takeaway:

“The important point is not how many tools there are.”
“It’s that they all speak the same language.”

Prepare the closing:

“This is what we mean by MolSysSuite.”
“Not a toolbox, but an ecosystem built around a shared model.”
