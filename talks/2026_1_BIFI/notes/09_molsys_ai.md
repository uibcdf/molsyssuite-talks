# Slide 09 — MolSys-AI (speaker notes, draft)

Purpose of this slide:
- Introduce MolSys-AI as a natural consequence of the existing architecture
- Emphasize AI as scientific assistance, not automation or replacement
- Show that assistance operates on structured molecular systems and workflows
- Clarify that MolSys-AI is an interaction layer (Chatbot, CLI, Agent), not a single tool

Core idea:
- MolSys-AI provides assistance for workflows built on structured molecular systems
- It operates on the same semantic core (MolSys) used by MolSysMT and MolSysViewer
- Intelligence becomes useful only because structure, visualization, and engineering foundations already exist

Conceptual role in the talk:
- This slide builds directly on the engineering foundations
- It introduces intelligence as a layer enabled by structure and reliability
- It prepares the audience to think about interaction, not algorithms or models

Key elements to convey:
- MolSys-AI does not operate on files or raw data
- It operates on structured molecular systems and workflows
- Assistance is contextual to the current MolSys and workflow state
- Human judgment remains central (human-in-the-loop)

MolSys-AI as an interaction layer:
- MolSys-AI is not a single application
- It can be accessed through different interfaces:
  - Chatbot
  - Command-line interface (CLI)
  - Agent-based workflows
- These are different entry points to the same assistance layer

Assistance, not automation:
- MolSys-AI is designed to support scientific reasoning
- It helps navigate workflows, interpret results, and explore alternatives
- It does not replace scientific judgment or decision-making

Grounding the assistance:
- Assistance is grounded in the MolSysSuite ecosystem
- Domain knowledge comes from documentation, tutorials, and code
- The goal is ecosystem-aware assistance, not generic conversation

Important emphasis:
- Intelligence is meaningful only in the presence of structure
- MolSys-AI depends on explicit semantics, not implicit assumptions
- This is a design choice, not a technological limitation

What NOT to do on this slide:
- Do not mention specific AI models or architectures
- Do not discuss training details, benchmarks, or performance metrics
- Do not frame MolSys-AI as autonomous or decision-making
- Do not present AI as a replacement for scientific expertise

Things NOT to explain:
- Large language models in general
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Internal agent orchestration
- Retrieval or embedding mechanics

Transition to next slide:
- Prepare the audience to see MolSysSuite as a growing ecosystem
- Emphasize that MolSys-AI evolves together with the rest of the tools

Timing:
- ~2 minutes

## Speech (draft)

- “Once you have structured systems, reproducible workflows, and solid foundations,
  scientific assistance becomes a natural next step.”

At this point in the talk, we are no longer talking about isolated tools,
but about an ecosystem.

Clarify what MolSys-AI is:

“MolSys-AI is not a single application.”
“It is an assistance layer for workflows built on structured molecular systems.”

Explain the tagline explicitly:

“When we say assistance, we really mean assistance.”
“This is not about automation or replacing scientific judgment.”

Explain interfaces:

“This assistance can be accessed in different ways.”
“As a chatbot, as a command-line interface, or as an agent embedded in workflows.”

Clarify scope:

“The important point is not the interface itself.”
“The important point is that the assistance operates on MolSys and on workflows,
not on files or raw inputs.”

Ground it in reality (spoken, brief, very important):

“To make this concrete, we are already running our own language model.”
“We are building retrieval and fine-tuning pipelines using our documentation,
tutorials, and parts of the codebase.”
“The goal is not a generic chatbot, but assistance grounded in the MolSysSuite ecosystem.”

Human-in-the-loop emphasis:

“The scientist remains in control.”
“The AI supports exploration, interpretation, and reasoning.”

Prepare the transition:

“With this in place, MolSysSuite becomes more than a set of tools.”
“It becomes an ecosystem that can grow in multiple directions.”
