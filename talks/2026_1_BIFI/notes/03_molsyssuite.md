# Slide 03 — MolSysSuite: an architectural response

Purpose of this slide:
- Explicitly name the response to the problem
- Introduce MolSysSuite as an idea before introducing tools
- Shift from diagnosis to proposal

Core idea:
- If the problem is fragmentation, the solution cannot be another isolated tool
- The response must be architectural

Key points to convey orally:
- MolSysSuite is not a single library
- It is an ecosystem designed around coherence and consistency
- Architecture comes before features
- Tools are consequences of the architecture, not the other way around

Important emphasis:
- This is not about replacing existing tools
- This is about providing a coherent foundation to build workflows
- The goal is long-term sustainability, not short-term convenience

Possible phrases:
- "The response we are proposing is architectural."
- "We call this response MolSysSuite."
- "MolSysSuite is an ecosystem, not a toolbox."
- "It is designed to remain coherent as it grows."

What NOT to explain yet:
- Names of specific modules
- Implementation details
- How many libraries exist

Transition to next slide:
- Move from the idea of an ecosystem to its core component
- Prepare the introduction of MolSysMT as the semantic nucleus

Timing:
- ~1–1.5 minutes

-------------------------------------------------------
“If the problem is fragmentation, the response cannot be just another tool.”

(pausa breve)

“The response has to be architectural.”

(señalas el nombre sin enfatizarlo demasiado)

“We call this response MolSysSuite.”

Ahora aclaras qué tipo de cosa es:

“MolSysSuite is not a single library, and it is not a toolbox.
It is an ecosystem designed around coherence and consistency.”

Ajustas expectativas (muy importante):

“The goal is not to replace existing tools, but to provide a coherent foundation
on top of which workflows can be built and extended.”

Y cierras preparando la entrada de lo concreto:

“To make this idea more tangible, I’ll start with the core of the ecosystem.”
