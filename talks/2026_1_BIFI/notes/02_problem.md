# The problem: fragmented molecular workflows

# Slide 02 — Fragmented workflows (speaker notes, draft)

Goal of this slide:
- Make the audience recognize the problem as their own
- Frame the problem as structural and historical, not accidental
- Avoid blaming specific tools or communities

Core idea to convey:
- The problem is not the quality of individual tools
- The problem is how workflows grow by accumulation rather than design

Narrative flow (oral):
- Molecular workflows are usually built over time, tool by tool
- Each tool solves a local problem, often very well
- But the global workflow becomes fragmented and hard to reason about

Key sentence (to use once, calmly, not at the beginning):
- "Most of us spend more time adapting tools than doing science."

Possible phrases to try:
- "Most of us don’t have a workflow — we have a history."
- "We spend a lot of time translating between tools instead of doing science."
- "The molecular system itself tends to disappear behind file formats."

Points to touch briefly after that sentence:
- Multiple representations of the same molecular system
- Different APIs and syntaxes for similar operations
- Constant conversion between formats
- Glue code that is fragile and rarely reusable

Important emphasis:
- This is not a complaint
- This is a shared experience across the field
- The issue is architectural, not technical
- The problem is not that tools are bad
- The problem is that they were not designed to work together coherently

What NOT to do:
- Do not list specific software packages
- Do not suggest solutions yet
- Do not sound frustrated or ironic

Transition to next slide:
- Reframe the situation as an architectural problem
- Prepare the ground for MolSysSuite as a response, not a replacement

Timing:
- ~2–3 minutes


>> posible discurso:

“Most of us build our molecular workflows over time, tool by tool.
Each tool usually solves a local problem very well.”

(pausa breve)

“But workflows rarely get designed as a whole.
They grow by accumulation.”

(otra pausa corta, miras al público)

“Over time, the overall workflow ends up fragmented.”

Aquí ya has nombrado el problema. Ahora lo reconoces como experiencia compartida:

“In practice, most of us spend more time adapting tools than doing science.”

(dicha una sola vez, sin énfasis dramático)

Y ahora lo acotas, para que no suene a queja:

“This is not because tools are bad.
In fact, many of them are excellent.”

(transición suave a lo estructural)

“The issue is architectural.
We constantly move the same molecular system across representations, APIs, and formats,
and the system itself tends to disappear behind all that glue code.”

Y cierras preparando la siguiente slide:

“So the question is not how to add yet another tool,
but how to think about molecular workflows in a more coherent way.”
