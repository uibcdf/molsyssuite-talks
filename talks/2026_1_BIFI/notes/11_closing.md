# Slide 11 — Closing: status, direction, and invitation (speaker notes)

Purpose of this slide:
- Close the talk with an honest and realistic message
- Set expectations about the current status of MolSysSuite
- Emphasize openness, use, and feedback rather than completeness
- Invite the audience to engage without pressure or hype

Core message:
- MolSysSuite is not finished
- It is already solid, usable, and coherent
- Its future direction benefits from real use and feedback

Role of the slide:
- This slide is not explanatory
- It is a synthesis and an invitation
- The text on the slide should stand on its own

How to use the slide:
- Let the audience read the sentence in silence
- Do not rush
- The spoken words should complement, not repeat, the text

Key points to reinforce orally:
- MolSysSuite is under active development
- MolSysMT and MolSysViewer are already mature and usable
- Other components are evolving within a clearly defined structure
- The ecosystem is intentionally scoped, not feature-complete

Clarifying expectations:
- This is not a finished ecosystem
- It is not presented as a polished product
- Stability and coherence matter more than completeness

Invitation:
- We are looking for users who want to try the tools in real workflows
- Early adopters and beta testers are especially welcome
- Feedback from actual use is what helps guide evolution

Tone to maintain:
- Honest
- Open
- Non-promotional
- Scientific

What NOT to do on this slide:
- Do not introduce new features
- Do not promise timelines or roadmaps
- Do not repeat technical details
- Do not oversell future capabilities

Transition to Q&A:
- Invite questions, discussion, and feedback
- Emphasize that questions can be technical or conceptual
- Signal openness to follow-up conversations

Timing:
- ~1 minute

## Speech (draft)

- “This last slide is meant to be read, not explained.”

Pause briefly.

“What you’ve seen today is not a finished ecosystem.”
“But it is already a solid foundation.”

Clarify status:

“MolSysMT and MolSysViewer are mature and usable today.”
“Other components are evolving within a coherent structure.”

Set expectations:

“We are not trying to do everything at once.”
“We care more about coherence than about completeness.”

Invitation:

“What we are really interested in now is use.”
“Using the tools, testing them in real workflows, and giving feedback.”

Close:

“So if there is one thing to take away from this talk,
it’s not a feature or a command.”
“It’s the idea of building tools that remain coherent as they grow.”

Invite questions:

“And with that, I’ll be happy to take questions or comments.”


“This is not a finished product, but it is a solid foundation we want to share,
test, and shape together.”
“So if there is one thing to take away from this talk,
it’s not a feature or a command — it’s the idea of building tools
that remain coherent as they grow.”
