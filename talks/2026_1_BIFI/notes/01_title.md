# Title and framing

Purpose of this opening:
- Set the tone of the talk (architectural, not a demo)
- Acknowledge the venue and the people hosting the talk
- Establish a personal and institutional connection with the audience

Opening acknowledgements:
- Briefly thank the organizing committee for the invitation and the opportunity
- Express genuine pleasure at being back at BIFI

Personal context (spoken, informal):
- Mention that this is the first time back at BIFI in a little over 16 years
- Recall that this was the institute where I did my PhD work
- Say that it is a pleasure to see again friends, colleagues, and former professors

Introduce ourselves:
- "We are Liliana and Diego"
- "We lead the Computational Biology and Drug Design Research Unit"
- "We are based at the Federico Gómez Children’s Hospital of Mexico,
  part of the Mexican National Institute of Health"

Contextual link to BIFI:
- Mention that Liliana also spent two research stays at BIFI
- Acknowledge that some people in the audience may already know her

Transition to the framing of the talk:
- Move naturally from personal/institutional context to the nature of the talk

Key framing statement (spoken, not on the slide):
- "This talk is intentionally not a live demo.
  Our goal today is to share the architectural ideas and design principles
  that shape MolSysSuite, because those are what determine whether tools
  remain useful and coherent in the long term."

What I want the audience to understand immediately:
- This is about foundations, not features
- The project is open-source, serious, and evolving
- The focus is on coherence, design, and sustainability

Mental transition to the next slide:
- From 'who we are and why we are here' to
  'why the current landscape of molecular workflows motivates this work'

Timing:
- ~1.5 minutes total (can be shortened if needed)
