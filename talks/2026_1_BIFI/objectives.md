# Objectives of the talk

This talk aims to:

1. Present MolSysSuite as an open-source, integrated ecosystem conceived
   as an architectural response to the fragmentation of current
   molecular modeling and early-stage drug design workflows, emphasizing
   coherence, consistency, and long-term sustainability over isolated
   features or performance claims.

2. Introduce MolSysMT and MolSysViewer as the foundational components
   that currently sustain the ecosystem, clarifying their respective
   roles, how they complement each other in practice, and the fact that
   they have already reached a high level of technical maturity,
   approaching their first stable (1.0) releases.

3. Communicate the design philosophy and guiding principles behind
   MolSysSuite to a broad audience of physicists, chemists, and
   biochemists, in order to provide a clear and realistic mental model
   of what the project currently offers, what it deliberately does not
   aim to do yet, and how it is intended to be used and extended.

4. Convey that MolSysSuite is an open and evolving project, where
   MolSys-AI naturally emerges from a semantically coherent tool
   ecosystem, and where feedback, contributions, and collaborations
   are actively sought to shape its short- and mid-term evolution.

additional message: “This is not a finished product, but it is a solid foundation we want to build on together.”
