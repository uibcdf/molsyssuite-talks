# Talk outline (20 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A)

## 1. Title and framing (1 min)
- Who we are
- What kind of talk this is
- Emphasis: foundations and architecture, not results

(INTENT: set expectations and avoid a "feature demo" mindset)

## 2. The problem: fragmented molecular workflows (3 min)
- Tool proliferation across modeling, MD, and analysis
- Inconsistent APIs and mental models
- Fragile glue code and poor long-term sustainability

(INTENT: make the audience recognize the problem as their own)

## 3. MolSysSuite as an architectural response (2 min)
- Ecosystem vs toolbox
- Coherence, consistency, and sustainability as design drivers
- Open-source, integrated alternative for drug-design-oriented workflows

(INTENT: answer "why MolSysSuite exists" before naming tools)

Objective 1 (problem side)

# Outline (draft)

3. MolSysMT (recorded demo)
4. MolSysViewer (recorded demo)
5. Engineering foundations (condensed slide)
6. MolSys-AI (LLaMA3-8B + RAG + light fine-tuning; now chatbot; future CLI/agent)
7. Ecosystem modules (TopoMT, ElastNetMT, PharmacophoreMT)
8. Closing + Q&A
