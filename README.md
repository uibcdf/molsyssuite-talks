# MolSysSuite Talks

This repository collects talks and presentations related to **MolSysSuite**.

Talks are narrative artifacts (slides, outlines, notes) and are not embedded in code repositories.
Large binaries (videos, big slide decks) may live externally (Dropbox/Drive) and should be referenced
from each talk directory.

Tool repositories link here via `resources/talks.yml`.
